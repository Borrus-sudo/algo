things i wanna achieve: range based and template based programming in C++

What is my goal?
    - Create a nice api to get shit done
    - Maybe creating a fancy dbg macro along the way
    - Allow for some constructs that make C++ feel more declarative.
    - Make sure the additional code is not that long 

something like 

3 main parts:
-> inp and data-structure intialization
-> itertation, some, all constructs easier, sentinel values, out-of-bounds, making ranges easier all together
-> easy api make-over for doing string manip, vector/list ops
-> print statements and dbg statements support 

what is so tough in iteration? the prev, next, curr
If I could easily get this then so cool man!!!!

-> A data structure that is int but modded under-the-hood
Treat all ranges like [start, end)
4 fundamental operations on -> list(int, ll)
                            -> string
    -> Access -> prev, curr, next
    -> Search -> binary_search, linear_search
    -> Insert -> insert at a position and specify the end
    -> Delete -> same as delete but just does not provide the subordinate stuff
Other support is gonna for be iterations.
    -> Should be easy to make any sort of iteration (evenIndices, oddIndices) (loop)
    -> Support for map, filter, reduce, some, all?
    -> Support for smin, smax, len?
    -> print statements
    -> dbg statements
    -> dyanmic bounds uptill and dynamic windows (How to group together similar valued stuff)
-> easy way for bitsets and easy way to get prefix sums

    

inp(n)
inp<int(n)>(nums)
bool has = some(nums, 1);
bool has = some(nums, (auto a) {
})
Figuring out the substring, subarray

I want a for that gives me the idx and the element both together
Maybe make sentinel values easy
The goal for iterat
for(nums, idx, elem) {
    
}

I want to make print certainly easier and also wanna be able to like easily return the function

Problems:
// figure out the rng::distance data type potential problem
// figure out the types better?
// Allow for tuple input too?
// Support a ModInt datatype
// copy should be working well for other stuff
// Support table of bits and better debugging?
// Figure out dbg to make it not lazy print so we can see output at end but dbg immediately
