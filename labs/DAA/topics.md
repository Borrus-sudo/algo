# Topics to practice for DAA

-   DP

    -   0/1 Knapsack
    -   LCS
    -   Assembly line
    -   TSP

-   Greedy

    -   Job Scheduling
    -   Primal, Kruskal
    -   Hoffman Coding
    -   Djikstra (Done)
        -   Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm, with non-negative edge weights
        -   TC: E\*log(V)
    -   Floyd

        -   All pairs shortest path algorithm

    -   Warshall Algorithm - Reachability

    -   Number of lengths
        -   Nice matmul thingy

-   Branch And Bound

    -   Basically optimized backtracking. We eleminate the obvious from the state space.
    -   TSP (I dunno why the matrix method even exists, a normal state space thing should work?)
    -   0/1 knapsack

-   Divide N Conquer

    -   Karatsuba
    -   Merge sort
    -   Quick sort

-   P vs NP problems
    -   TSP
